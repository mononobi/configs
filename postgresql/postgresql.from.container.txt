# to connect from any docker container to a local postgresql server:

1. go to '/etc/postgresql/VERSION_NUM' directory.

2. set listen_addresses = '*' in 'postgresql.conf' file.

3. add two new host records in 'pg_hba.conf' file inside IPv4 section as example:

# docker containers
host    all             all             172.18.0.0/16           md5
# real local ip
host    all             all             192.168.2.0/16          md5

# note that '172.18.0.0' is the network ip of containers and might
# be different on different systems.

4. restart postgresql service:

sudo systemctl restart postgresql
