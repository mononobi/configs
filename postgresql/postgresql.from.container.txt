# to connect from any docker container to a local postgresql server:

1. go to '/etc/postgresql/VERSION_NUM' directory.

2. set listen_addresses = '*' in 'postgresql.conf' file.

3. add two new host records in 'pg_hba.conf' file inside IPv4 section as example:

# docker containers
host    all             all             172.18.0.0/16           md5
# real local ip
host    all             all             192.168.0.0/16          md5

# note that '172.18.0.0' is the network ip of containers and might
# be different on different systems.

4. restart postgresql service:

sudo systemctl restart postgresql

5. if you have firewall enabled, you must allow the postgresql port
   (5432 by default) in firewall to let containers connect to it:

sudo ufw allow 5432

# or if you want to only allow connections from container's network:

sudo ufw allow from 172.18.0.0/16 to any port 5432

# note that '172.18.0.0' is the network ip of containers and might
# be different on different systems.

# then check whether the port is opened:

sudo ufw status
