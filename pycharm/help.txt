1. `config` folder must be placed into /home/.PyCharm*/

2. `original.vmoptions` contains the default pycharm vmoptions that causes ui freezing multiple times per working session on some linux distros.
    vmoptions in `config` folder is revised so that does not cause ui freezes anymore. but if you have less memory, make sure to change the memory related stuff.
    ui freezing is not related to memory configs.
