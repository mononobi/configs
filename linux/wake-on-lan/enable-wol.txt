# to enable wake on lan, you should enable it on bios, router and the operating system.

####################### 1. ENABLE ON BIOS #######################

# go to your pc bios and to the 'APM configuration' menu and
# enable 'Wake on LAN' or 'Wake on PCIe'.

####################### 2. ENABLE ON ROUTER #######################

# go to your router's admin page and select your pc from the networks list
# and check 'Wake on LAN' setting.

####################### 3. ENABLE ON OPERATING SYSTEM #######################

# in this guide we assume that our network interface is 'eno1'.
# you should replace it with your actual network interface name.

# execute this to get the name of your network interface:

ifconfig

# execute this command for your network interface:

sudo ethtool eno1

# you should see something like this:

# Supports Wake-on: pumbg
# Wake-on: g

# the letter 'g' on each line specifies that wol is available and enabled.
# first line tells that wake on lan is supported.
# second line tells that wake on lan is enabled.

# if you had this on the second line:

# Wake-on: d

# it means that wake on lan is not enabled, and you should enable it.

# execute this to enable wake on lan:

sudo ethtool -s eno1 wol g

# this configuration is not permanent and wake on lan will be disabled every
# time you restart your pc. to make it permanent, copy these 2 files into
# '~/.local/sbin' and also add a startup application entry in 'Startup Applications'
# and point it to the first file:

# linux/install/commands/sbin/wol-enable
# linux/install/commands/sbin/wol-status

# you should replace the 'PASSWORD' with your own password in the files.

# every time you turn on your pc, wake on lan will get enabled automatically.

# you can use any of these apps on android to turn your pc on from your mobile phone:
