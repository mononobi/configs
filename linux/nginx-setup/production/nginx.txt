# if you want to put your application server behind nginx, you can
# use the fully featured sample config file 'app.conf' as your guide.

# if you want to enable ssl certificate, see the related guidance in
# 'ssl-certificate' directory.

# after you've been configured your 'app.conf' file, execute
# this to copy 'app.conf' file to nginx configs:

sudo cp app.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d

# execute this to check if everything is working:

sudo nginx -t

# restart nginx and your web browser (both commands are the same):

sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo nginx -s reload
