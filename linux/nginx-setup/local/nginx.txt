# if you want to put any application behind nginx to set a
# custom url for it, do it as follows:

# execute this to open 'etc/hosts' file:

sudo vi /etc/hosts

# add your custom url instead of 'app' at the line which contains 'localhost':

127.0.0.1	localhost app

# you can set any name you want instead of 'app'.
# note that if you changed it to another name here, you must
# also change it in 'app.conf' file.
# save the file and exit.

# rename 'app.conf' to the real name of your app if you want.
# open 'app.conf' and change these values:

vi app.conf

# 'app' -> to any name you have set in '/etc/hosts' file.
# 'PORT_NUMBER' -> to the port number of your application.
# save the file and exit.

# execute this to copy 'app.conf' file to nginx configs:

sudo cp app.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d

# execute this to check if everything is working:

sudo nginx -t

# restart nginx and your web browser:

sudo systemctl restart nginx
