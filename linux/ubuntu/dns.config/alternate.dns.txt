# use these dns addresses in network settings instead of automatic dns.
# you can also set these in each web browser separately:

# cloudflare (recommended):

1.1.1.1
1.0.0.1

# google

8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4

# cloudflare for mobile:

one.one.one.one
1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com

# now, you need to disconnect and then reconnect your network.
