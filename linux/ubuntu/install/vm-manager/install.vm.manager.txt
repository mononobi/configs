sudo apt-get install virt-manager

# after installation, execute this command to see if your cpu supports kvm:

kvm-ok

# or you can execute this command and if it returns a value more than 0, your cpu supports kvm:

egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

# if your cpu supports kvm, install these packages:

sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils

# after running the application for the first time, execute this:

sudo chown YOUR_USER:YOUR_USER /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock

# to perform the above command on each system boot (which is required), you can edit
# and copy the 'vm.prepare' file into '/usr/local/sbin' and add it into startup
# applications.
