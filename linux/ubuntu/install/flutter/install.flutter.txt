# install theses requirements:

sudo apt-get install bash curl file git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa

# install flutter using snap (DOES NOT WORK, USE MANUAL INSTALLATION INSTEAD):

sudo snap install flutter --classic

# install flutter manually:

# download an stable release from:

https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases?tab=linux

for example:

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_2.2.1-stable.tar.xz

# extract downloaded file in your home directory, for example:

mkdir ~/.flutter-sdk
tar -xf flutter_linux_2.2.1-stable.tar.xz -C ~/.flutter-sdk

# update your PATH to include flutter sdk bin:

# open ~/.bashrc:

vi ~/.bashrc

# add these lines into file:
# replace [PATH_OF_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] with the directory path of your sdk.

export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_OF_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/bin"

# for example:

export PATH="$PATH:/home/mono/.flutter-sdk/flutter/bin"

# save and close the file and run:

source ~/.bashrc

# execute this to check the PATH:

echo $PATH

# execute this to check the path of flutter bin and dart bin:

which flutter
which flutter dart

# execute this to pre-download all required dependencies for android and iOS;

flutter precache

# execute this to check that all required dependencies are met:

flutter doctor -v

# run this command to install extra dependencies for desktop support:

sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev

flutter config --enable-web
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter config --enable-android
flutter config --enable-ios

# to see current configs, run:
