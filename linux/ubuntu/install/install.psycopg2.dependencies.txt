# these packages must be installed to be able to install and build psycopg2 from pip.
# for some older python versions you must also specify the exact
# version, for example python3.6-dev.

sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

# you also need pg_config program. it is usually installed by the libpq-dev package
# but sometimes it is not in a PATH directory. having it in the PATH greatly streamlines
# the installation, so try running pg_config --version. if it returns an error or an unexpected
# version number then locate the directory containing the pg_config shipped with the right
# libpq version (usually /usr/lib/postgresql/X.Y/bin/) and add it to the PATH:
# $ export PATH=/usr/lib/postgresql/X.Y/bin/:$PATH
# you only need pg_config to compile psycopg2, not for its regular usage.

# now you could install pycopg2 from pip.
# pip install psycopg2
