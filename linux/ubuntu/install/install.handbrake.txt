# flatpak is the recommended way to install:

flatpak install flathub fr.handbrake.ghb

# you can also install using snap, but it's not recommended at all as
# it has a terrible performance:

sudo snap install handbrake-jz --channel=latest/stable

# always check for the latest channel before installing:

snap info handbrake-jz
