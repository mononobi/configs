# flatpak is the recommended way to install:

flatpak install flathub org.telegram.desktop

# you can also install using snap, but it's not recommended at all as
# it has a terrible performance:

sudo snap install telegram-desktop --channel=latest/stable

# always check for the latest channel before installing:

snap info telegram-desktop

# apt install is not recommended and has an obsolete version.

# sudo apt-get install telegram-desktop
