# you could install the normal version using ubuntu package manager.
# but use the "pgadmin4-local" script to run it to prevent further problems.
# you have to first install postgresql and then:

sudo apt-get install pgadmin4

sudo cp pgadmin4-local /usr/local/sbin

sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/sbin/pgadmin4-local

sudo chown YOUR_USER:YOUR_USER /usr/local/sbin/pgadmin4-local

# you have to change "SERVER_MODE=False" in "/usr/share/pgadmin4/web/config.py"
# and execute this command:

sudo mkdir /var/cache/pgadmin

# now you could put "pgadmin-local" into startup commands to make pgadmin4 available on boot.
