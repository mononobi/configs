# you need to specify the credentials store in $HOME/.docker/config.json to tell
# the docker engine to use it. The value of the config property should be the suffix
# of the program to use (i.e. everything after docker-credential-)
# if you are currently logged in, run docker logout to remove the credentials
# from the file and run docker login again.
# now put these into config file:

# {
#   "credsStore": "pass"
# }
