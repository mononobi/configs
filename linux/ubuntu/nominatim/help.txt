# nominatim is a service for geocoding (getting a geolocation from an address or name).
# the provided docker-compose file can be used to set up an on-premise nominatim instance.

# to see detailed info on this docker-compose file, visit here:
# 'https://github.com/mediagis/nominatim-docker'

# note that you should change the two mounted volumes to a location
# which is available on your server. you should change the host part only (left side).
# host:guest

# you should also set a password for database instance in the
# file instead of 'DATABASE_PASSWORD_OF_YOUR_CHOICE'.

# you can change the values of 'PBF_URL' and 'REPLICATION_URL' to get
# different map data for other locations.

# this docker-compose will prepare apache web-server, postgresql and nominatim instances.
