# you can override any required configs in redis.conf sample file
# and copy it in redis config location: /etc/redis/redis.conf

# to start a redis cli, execute:
redis-cli

# start redis server on system startup.
sudo systemctl enable redis

# start redis server.
sudo systemctl start redis

# restart redis server.
sudo systemctl restart redis

# get redis server status.
sudo systemctl status redis

# stop redis server.
sudo systemctl stop redis

# to let clients connect to redis on your system's real ip address beside
# the local address, change this:

bind 127.0.0.1 ::1

to this in '/etc/redis/redis.conf' file:

bind 127.0.0.1 ::1 192.168.2.104

# where '192.168.2.104' is your system's real local ip address.
# then restart redis server:

sudo systemctl restart redis
