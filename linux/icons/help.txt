# if you want to use any of these icons for any app, do the following:

# copy the icon into this path:

sudo cp ICON_FILE /usr/share/pixmaps

# find the shortcut (.desktop) file of the app, it is likely in one of these locations:

/usr/share/applications
~/.local/share/applications
/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications
~/.gnome/apps
~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications

# open the file and change the value of 'Icon' key and set it to
# the new icon name without file extension. for example:

Icon=regex101

# now reload the ui and the app icon would be changed.
# reload the ui by holding 'Alt + F2' and writing 'r' and then hitting 'Enter'.
