# to be able to get write access to an external ext4 partition
# (not included in linux file system), you should find out the mount
# point of the given drive, then execute these commands:

sudo chgrp adm /MOUNT_POINT
sudo chmod g+w /MOUNT_POINT

# for example:

sudo chgrp adm /media/username/56d0c0ab-60a0-48bf-955d-bc2f283009b6
sudo chmod g+w /media/username/56d0c0ab-60a0-48bf-955d-bc2f283009b6
