# to mount partitions on startup, you should add each partition with its
# UUID into fstab file. to get all available partitions and their UUID,
# execute:

sudo blkid

# then replace the fstab file in /etc/fstab
# the 'samples/fstab.sample' file should be changed according to your partitions.
# the 'samples/fstab.ntfs' file shows how to mount ntfs partitions.
# the 'samples/fstab.with.external.hdd' shows how to mount an external hdd
# on '/mnt' instead of '/media/user_name'.
# the 'fstab' file is the file to be merged with available file and is the most recent file.
