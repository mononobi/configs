# to create a shared folder where all users on the same machine
# can access and modify, do the following:

# create a folder in '/home':

sudo mkdir /home/share

# create a group for all users who you want to give access to the share folder:

sudo addgroup share_group

# add each user into the newly created group:

sudo adduser USER_NAME share_group

# now copy all the initial files and folders into the share folder.

# execute this to make the share group the group owner of the share folder:

sudo chown -R :share_group /home/share

# execute this to make all current and future contents of share folder
# accessible by the owner and the share group:

sudo chmod -R 2770 /home/share

# now all users must logout and login again to access the share folder.
