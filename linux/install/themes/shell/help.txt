# the zip file contains 3 material shell themes for gnome 40.

# the blue one is revised and works perfectly.
# the black and mint one must be revised to fit correctly.

# extract 'Material-Originals-Shell-40.zip' file and put the top folders in:
# '~/.themes'

# now open 'Gnome Tweaks' and change shell in 'Appearance' tab.
# you must have installed gnome 'user-themes' extension first.

# to revise each theme, open 'gnome-shell.css' file of it and
# search for these values and correct the related css attributes:

/* Top Bar */

/* Activities Ripple */
#panel #panelActivities.panel-button

/* Dash */
#dash .overview-icon
.dash-item-container .app-well-app, .show-apps
.dash-label
