# extract 'Material-Originals-Icons-Blue.zip' file and put the top 2 folders in:
# '~/.icons'

# note that both folders must be copied, otherwise it may not work.

# now open 'Gnome Tweaks' and change icons in 'Appearance' tab.

# you can also copy those 2 folders into '/usr/share/icons' to be accessible by all users.
