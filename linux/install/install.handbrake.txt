# flatpak is the recommended way to install:

flatpak install flathub fr.handbrake.ghb

# you can also install using snap, but it's not recommended at all as
# it has a terrible performance:

sudo snap install handbrake-jz --channel=latest/stable

# always check for the latest channel before installing:

snap info handbrake-jz

# IMPORTANT NOTE:

# when you want to encode with handbrake, always specify the max allowed cpu thread
# count for handbrake. otherwise, in the middle of encoding, screen might go blank, and
# you have to restart your pc. this is more common when you have an AMD Ryzen cpu.

# to set the max cpu thread count, go to the 'Video' tab and in
# the 'More Settings' field add this value:

threads=VALUE

# you should specify the correct 'VALUE' based on your cpu's actual core count and thread count.

# for example:

2 core (2 thread)  -> threads=1
2 core (4 thread)  -> threads=2
4 core (4 thread)  -> threads=2
4 core (8 thread)  -> threads=5
6 core (6 thread)  -> threads=3
6 core (12 thread) -> threads=7
8 core (8 thread)  -> threads=5
8 core (16 thread) -> threads=10

# note that these values are for when you've set 'Preset' to 'slow'. if you choose higher
# speeds for 'Preset', you may have to reduce the thread count to get the same amount
# of cpu utilization.
