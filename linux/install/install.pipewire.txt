# PipeWire is an audio server which has better quality than PulseAudio
# which is the default on ubuntu and most other distros.

# to enable PipeWire and disable PulseAudio, execute these commands. note that
# you should not execute all commands with sudo, only some of them:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipewire-debian/pipewire-upstream
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-pipewire libpipewire-0.3-{0,dev,modules} libspa-0.2-{bluetooth,dev,jack,modules} pipewire{,-{audio-client-libraries,pulse,media-session,bin,locales,tests}}
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
systemctl --user --now enable pipewire pipewire-pulse

# now execute this to check if PipeWire is enabled:

pactl info

# to disable PipeWire and revert to PulseAudio, execute these commands:

sudo apt remove pipewire pipewire-audio-client-libraries
sudo apt remove gstreamer1.0-pipewire libpipewire-0.3-{0,dev,modules} libspa-0.2-{bluetooth,dev,jack,modules} pipewire{,-{audio-client-libraries,pulse,media-session,bin,locales,tests}}
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user --now enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket

# now execute this to check if PulseAudio is enabled:
