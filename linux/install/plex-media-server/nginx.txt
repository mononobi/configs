# if you want to put the plex server behind nginx to set a
# custom url for it, do it as follows:

# execute this to open 'etc/hosts' file:

sudo nano /etc/hosts

# add your custom url instead of 'plex' at the line which contains 'localhost':

127.0.0.1 localhost plex

# you can set any name you want instead of 'plex'.
# note that if you changed it to another name here, you must
# also change it in 'plex.conf' file.

# save the file and exit.

# execute this to copy 'plex.conf' file to nginx configs:

sudo cp plex.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d

# execute this to check if everything is working:

sudo nginx -t

# restart nginx and your web browser:

sudo systemctl restart nginx
