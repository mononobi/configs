# NOTE:
# change 'mono' to your own username in this guide.
# change '/mnt/plex/' to your own root path for custom plex data store.

# you should download the plex media server from here:
# https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/
# then go to download path and execute:

sudo dpkg -i file_name.deb

# then check status:

sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver

# if it is not running, execute following command to run it:

sudo systemctl start plexmediaserver

# execute this command:

sudo systemctl enable plexmediaserver

# execute the following command to see the source list file name of plex:

sudo dpkg -L plexmediaserver

# the file is something like this:
# /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list

# open the above file and uncomment the last line of it.

############ RUN THE BELOW COMMAND IF YOU ARE NOT ON UBUNTU 20+ OR DEBIAN 10+ ############

wget -q https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key -O - | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/plexmediaserver.asc

############ RUN THE ABOVE COMMAND IF YOU ARE NOT ON UBUNTU 20+ OR DEBIAN 10+ ############

sudo apt update

# now plex media server will be updated through normal os updates.

# if you want to have all plex metadata and indices folder in another place than the default one, or
# you want to restore all your metadata after changing the OS you can do the following:

# stop the plex server:

sudo systemctl stop plexmediaserver

# we assume that the root path that we want to store plex data in, is as follows:

/mnt/plex/

# if it is your initial installation, and you don't have any metadata yet, create these folders:

mkdir -p /mnt/plex/Plex/plexmediaserver/Library/'Application Support'
mkdir /mnt/plex/Plex/tmp

# note that if you already have those folders, your user must be the owner of those
# folders, if it's not, execute these commands:

sudo chown -R mono:mono /mnt/plex/Plex
sudo chmod -R 775 /mnt/plex/Plex

# delete the default metadata folder:

sudo rm -r /var/lib/plexmediaserver

# copy the 'override.conf' file into this location with these commands
# (change 'mono' and '/mnt/plex' to your own username and root path in the file):

sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/plexmediaserver.service.d
sudo cp override.conf /etc/systemd/system/plexmediaserver.service.d
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# start the plex server:

sudo systemctl enable plexmediaserver
sudo systemctl start plexmediaserver

# allow the 32400 port in ufw:

sudo ufw allow 32400

# add all client IPs which want to connect to the server in plex 'Network' settings.
# for example if your default gateway is '192.168.178.1', add these to the allowed IPs:
# localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.178.0/24

# PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT:

# If the system on which the Plex server is running has 8GB or more RAM, do this to
# make transcoding temp data be stored on RAM for fast data access:

# Go to Plex web interface.
# Go to Settings -> Transcoder.
# Set these two values:
# Transcoder temporary directory -> /dev/shm/plex
# Downloads temporary directory -> /mnt/plex/Plex/tmp/downloads

# DEFAULT PATHS:

# plex media server default metadata and index folder is:
/var/lib/plexmediaserver

# plex media server executables directory is:
/usr/lib/plexmediaserver

# plex media server service file is:
/lib/systemd/system/plexmediaserver.service

# plex media server service drop-in file must be created in:
/etc/systemd/system/plexmediaserver.service.d/override.conf
