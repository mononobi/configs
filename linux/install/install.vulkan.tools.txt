# vulkan-tools is a tool for inspecting vulkan information.
# you need to have a vulkan enabled gpu to be able to use it.

# installation:

sudo apt install vulkan-tools

# get info on installed vulkan instance (including vulkan and mesa versions):

vulkaninfo

# to check whether vulkan backend is enabled on chrome, type this in the url bar:

chrome://gpu

# if your gpu supports vulkan, you can enable vulkan in chrome browser as graphics
# backed by typing this in the url bar and setting it to 'Enabled':

chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan

# if your gpu supports vulkan but chrome crashed after enabling vulkan backend, it
# could be because the mesa driver version on your system is outdated.
