# plugin. then from the file menu select 'Manage IDE Settings -> Settings Repository...'.
# then add the url of your new repository (use https url, not ssh) and then click on
# one of these options based on what you want to do:

# OVERWRITE REMOTE:
# if you have just created a settings repository and want to initialize it with your
# current local settings.

# OVERWRITE LOCAL:
# if you have installed a new IDE and you want to get all the settings from a remote
# repository which has been already initialized.

# MERGE:
# if you want to synchronize your current local settings with remote settings
# on the repository which has been already initialized.
