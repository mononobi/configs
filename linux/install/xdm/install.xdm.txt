########## INTEGRATION FOR FIREFOX ##########

# go to firefox add-ons page and search for xdm.
# its url is this as of now:

# https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xdm-browser-monitor/

# install the xdm add-on and also enable it in 'Private Mode'.

########## INTEGRATION FOR GOOGLE CHROME (AND OTHER CHROMIUM BASED BROWSERS) ##########

# the xdm extension is no longer available on chrome web store.
# you have to install the extension locally.

# for this, do the following:

# 1. copy the 'files/chrome-extension-random-id.zip' file into a permanent
#    location and extract it (ex. ~/.config/xdm-chrome-extension).
# 2. on chrome, go to 'Settings -> Extensions' menu and enable 'Developer mode'.
# 3. click on 'Load unpacked' button on top menu bar and select the root folder of the
#    extension which you've just extracted. note that you should select the folder in-which
#    the 'manifest.json' file is located.
# 4. after the extension has been installed successfully, go to extension details and
#    enable 'Allow in Incognito' and disable 'Collect errors'.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# you should keep the extension folder intact and do not move or rename it. otherwise it
# will be removed from chrome, and you should repeat the above steps to reinstall it.

# CLARIFICATION:
# the difference between 'chrome-extension-original.zip' and 'chrome-extension-random-id.zip'
# files is that the 'chrome-extension-original.zip' file has the 'key' in its
# 'manifest.json' file and uses the original id of xdm extension from chrome web-store.
# the 'chrome-extension-random-id.zip' file has its 'key' removed from 'manifest.json' file
# and each time you install it on chrome, it assigns a new id to it.
# the problem with the 'chrome-extension-original.zip' file is that if you have already
# installed xdm extension from chrome web-store on any of your devices before it has been
# removed from web-store, and it has got synced to your other devices, if you
# try to load it locally with the same id, chrome will silently remove it without
# giving you any errors. so you can not install it with the same id.
# because of that the 'chrome-extension-random-id.zip' file is provided.
