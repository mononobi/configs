########## INTEGRATION FOR FIREFOX ##########

# go to firefox add-ons page and search for xdm.
# its url is this as of now:

# https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xdm-browser-monitor/

# install the xdm add-on and also enable it in 'Private Mode'.

########## INTEGRATION FOR GOOGLE CHROME (AND OTHER CHROMIUM BASED BROWSERS) ##########

# the xdm extension is no longer available on chrome web store.
# you have to install the extension locally.

# for this, do the following:

# 1. copy the 'files/chrome-extension.zip' file into a permanent location and extract it.
# 2. on chrome, go to 'Settings -> Extensions' and enable 'Developer mode'.
# 3. click on 'Load unpacked' button on top menu bar and select the root folder of the
#    extension which you've just extracted. note that you should select the folder in-which
#    the 'manifest.json' file is located.
# 4. after the extension has been installed successfully, go to extension details and
#    enable 'Allow in Incognito' and disable 'Collect errors'.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# you should keep the extension folder intact and do not move or rename it. otherwise it
# will be removed from chrome, and you should repeat the above steps to reinstall it.
