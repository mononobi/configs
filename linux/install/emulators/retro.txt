# to be able to load your games into the app, you should give access to the games folders.
# you can execute this command once for each folder you want to give access to:

sudo flatpak override --filesystem=PATH_TO_GAMES_FOLDER com.github.AmatCoder.mednaffe

# for example:

sudo flatpak override --filesystem="/mnt/archives/Applications/Games/Emulator Games/NES" com.github.AmatCoder.mednaffe
sudo flatpak override --filesystem="/mnt/archives/Applications/Games/Emulator Games/MegaDrive" com.github.AmatCoder.mednaffe

# IMPORTANT:
# if you have no sound coming out from games, you should try different sound
# drivers in the settings:
# 'Global Settings -> Sound -> Driver'
# try different drivers to see which one will work.
# on ubuntu the 'sdl' driver works.
