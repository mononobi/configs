# this is a PS3 emulator:

flatpak install flathub net.rpcs3.RPCS3

# you should download PS3 firmware from Sony, and then install it inside the app.
# get the firmware from this link:

# https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/

# after app installation has been finished, install the downloaded firmware
# from 'File -> Install Firmware' menu.

# each game should be in the following folder structure to work:

# Game Title -> Region ID -> PS3_GAME, PS3_UPDATE, PS3_DISC.SFB

# for example:

# WRC 5 -> BLES02242 -> PS3_GAME, PS3_UPDATE, PS3_DISC.SFB

# inside the region id folder, there should be these subdirectories:
# PS3_GAME
# PS3_UPDATE (optional)

# inside the region id folder, there should be this file:
# PS3_DISC.SFB

# when you want to add games into emulator app, you should select game title
# folders in-which region id folder is resided.
