############# NEW INSTALLATION #############

sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install -y wget
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/pgdg.asc
RELEASE=$(lsb_release -cs)
echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ ${RELEASE}"-pgdg main | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list

# open the created file:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list

# and add '[arch=amd64]' to this line after 'deb':
# deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ jammy-pgdg main

# it should become this:
# deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ jammy-pgdg main

sudo apt update

# change 'VERSION' to the version you want to be installed, for example 14:

sudo apt -y install postgresql-VERSION

# after installation has been finished, you can copy the provided 'db.conf' file
# into postgresql 'conf.d' folder to modify required configs:

sudo cp db.conf /etc/postgresql/VERSION/main/conf.d

########## ↓↓ IF YOU WANT TO LOGIN AS AN INDEPENDENT DATABASE USER IN TERMINAL ↓↓ ##########

# NOTE THAT: this will prevent any non-interactive access to database (such as cronjobs, replication and ...)

# if you want to login as any user in database without
# having the relevant user in your linux, open 'pg_hba.conf' file:

sudo nano /etc/postgresql/VERSION/main/pg_hba.conf

# replace this line:
# local   all             postgres                                peer

# with this line:
# local   all             postgres                                md5

# replace this line:
# local   all             all                                     peer

# with this line:
# local   all             all                                     md5

# save the file.

# now you can login to any database user without the need to
# switch to the relevant user in terminal:

psql -U DB_USERNAME

# for example:

psql -U postgres

########## ↑↑ IF YOU WANT TO LOGIN AS AN INDEPENDENT DATABASE USER IN TERMINAL ↑↑ ##########

# execute this to set a password for 'postgres' user on database:

sudo su - postgres
psql -c "alter user postgres with password 'PASSWORD_HERE'"

# restart the postgresql service:

sudo systemctl restart postgresql

# check that postgresql is up and running:

sudo ss -tunelp | grep 5432
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# if you didn't change the 'pg_hba.conf' file, you can connect to postgresql
# using terminal this way. note that you should have a relevant user with
# the same username as the database user on your linux.

sudo su DB_USERNAME
psql -U DB_USERNAME

# for example:

sudo su postgres
psql -U postgres
