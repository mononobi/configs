# install using apt (RECOMMENDED):

# go to 'https://code.visualstudio.com/Download' page and download the latest version.
# then execute this, it will also add the repository and signing key so
# the vscode will be updated automatically through normal os updates:

sudo apt install ./DOWNLOADED_FILE.deb

# install using snap (NOT RECOMMENDED because some extensions do not work correctly):

sudo snap install code --classic --channel=latest/stable

# always check for the latest channel before installing:

snap info code
