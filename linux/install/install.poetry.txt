# poetry is a python package and dependency manager.
# it's an alternative to pipenv and others.

# IMPORTANT: first install the dependencies, otherwise poetry installation will fail:

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# installation:

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# updating poetry itself:

poetry self update

# check version:

poetry --version

# uninstallation:

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --uninstall

# poetry default executable path:

# ~/.local/bin/poetry

# to add dependencies using command line, execute this when you are in an active virtual env:

poetry add DEPENDENCY_NAME

# for example:

poetry add Pillow
