# this installation method is the recommended way:

# update the version to the newest stable version if available.
# note that even version numbers are those with LTS support (ex. 22, 24, ...) and are preferred.

cd ~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
node -v
npm -v

# NOTE:
# If you have already installed an older version of node using this script, you can just update
# the version number in the `curl` line and execute the same script again to update the node
# installation to a new version.
