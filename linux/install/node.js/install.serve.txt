# serve is a simple http server which allows you to run your pre-built js
# app (react, angular and ...) in production mode for testing.

# first you need to build your app (depending on which tool you're using):

# using npm:

npm build

# using yarn:

yarn build

# now execute this command to install and run 'serve' as a temporary
# package without really installing it:

npx serve -s BUILD_FOLDER_NAME

# now the app is running on the port which 'serve' will tell you (probably 3000).

# if you want to install serve globally instead, run this (NOT RECOMMENDED):

sudo npm install --location=global serve

# and run the app with this command:

serve -s BUILD_FOLDER_NAME

# 'BUILD_FOLDER_NAME' probably would be one of these depending
# on which tool you've used to build the app:
# 'dist' or 'build'
