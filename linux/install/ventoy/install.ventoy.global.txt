# ventoy is a cross-platform usb multiboot creator.
# it works on windows and linux and can create bootables for windows and linux.

# first, head over to 'https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases'
# and download the latest version.

# execute this command to extract the downloaded file:

tar -xf ventoy-X.Y.Z-linux.tar.gz

# execute this command to make a directory for ventoy on '/opt':

sudo mkdir /opt/ventoy

# copy the extracted directory into created directory:

sudo cp -r ventoy-X.Y.Z /opt/ventoy/

# rename the copied directory:

sudo mv /opt/ventoy/ventoy-X.Y.Z /opt/ventoy/ventoy-current

# open the 'files/ventoy.desktop' file and replace the line which starts with 'Exec'
# with 'Exec=/opt/ventoy/ventoy-current/VentoyGUI.x86_64'.

# copy the modified 'files/ventoy.desktop' file into '/usr/share/applications':

sudo cp files/ventoy.desktop /usr/share/applications

# execute this to change the access level of the copied file:

sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/applications/ventoy.desktop

# copy the 'files/ventoy.png' icon image into '/usr/share/pixmaps':

sudo cp files/ventoy.png /usr/share/pixmaps

# execute this to make the app file executable:

sudo chmod 755 /opt/ventoy/ventoy-current/VentoyGUI.x86_64

# execute this to make your user the owner of the app folder:

sudo chown -R USER:USER /opt/ventoy

# press 'Alt + F2' and input 'r' and hit 'Enter' to reload the shell.
# now the app should be visible on your application menu.

# if you want to update the version of ventoy, you only need to download the
# newer version and then extract it into '/opt/ventoy/ventoy-current'
# and make the '/opt/ventoy/ventoy-current/VentoyGUI.x86_64' file executable.
