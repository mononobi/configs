# ventoy is a cross-platform usb multiboot creator.
# it works on windows and linux and can create bootables for windows and linux.

# first, head over to 'https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases'
# and download the latest version.

# execute this command to extract the downloaded file:

tar -xf ventoy-X.Y.Z-linux.tar.gz

# execute this command to make a directory for ventoy:

mkdir ~/.local/share/ventoy

# copy the extracted directory into created directory:

cp -r ventoy-X.Y.Z ~/.local/share/ventoy

# rename the copied directory:

mv ~/.local/share/ventoy/ventoy-X.Y.Z ~/.local/share/ventoy/ventoy-current

# open the 'files/ventoy.desktop' file and replace 'USER_NAME' with the actual username.

# copy the modified 'files/ventoy.desktop' file into '~/.local/share/applications':

cp files/ventoy.desktop ~/.local/share/applications

# copy the 'files/ventoy.png' icon image into '~/.local/share/icons':

cp files/ventoy.png ~/.local/share/icons

# execute this to make the app file executable:

sudo chmod 755 ~/.local/share/ventoy/ventoy-current/VentoyGUI.x86_64

# press 'Alt + F2' and input 'r' and hit 'Enter' to reload the shell.
# now the app should be visible on your application menu.

# if you want to update the ventoy app, you only need to download the
# newer version and then extract it into '~/.local/share/ventoy/ventoy-current'
# and make the '~/.local/share/ventoy/ventoy-current/VentoyGUI.x86_64' file executable.
