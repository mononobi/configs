# These tools let you stress-test the CPU and monitor the temperatures in real-time.

# Install the tools:

sudo apt install s-tui stress

# To ensure you can see the motherboard and CPU temperatures, you
# need to scan the hardware sensors (On modern systems it is usually not
# needed and will not find anything)

sudo sensors-detect

# Answer with default (just hit Enter) to all the questions.
# At the end, if it asks to add modules to /etc/modules, type yes.

# Run this command if the previous one did not succeed because your system is a modern system:

sensors

# It should output values for different sensors.
# Only if `sensors` command did not produce output, try these commands:

sudo modprobe nct6775
sensors

# If the second `sensors` command did not produce anything, you cannot use this stress test.
# If it produced valid output, you can continue.

# Run the monitoring tool:

sudo s-tui

# If `s-tui` shows a temperature graph, you are successful.

# To start the stress test, use the arrow keys to navigate to the "Stress" option in the left
# sidebar and press Space (or click it if mouse support is active).

########################## METRICS TO LOOK FOR ##########################

# Frequency: Should stay steady at roughly close to max (depending on boost). It should not
# drop suddenly to 400MHz or 800MHz (that indicates thermal throttling).

# Temperature: The CPU is designed to run hot. Seeing 85°C or even 90°C is normal under
# 100% synthetic load.

# System Stability: Let it run for 10 minutes. If the screen doesn't go blank, the VRMs are
# doing their job.

# CPU Temperature: Tctl / Tccd1 / CPU / Tdie
# VRM Temperature: Composite / Motherboard / Temp1 / temp2 / nct6798
# iGPU Temperature: Edge
# RAM Temperature: Spd*

# If you see a temperature that starts low (e.g., 40°C) and very slowly climbs to
# 50-60°C and stays there, that is the VRM. If it shoots up instantly to 100°C+, that's a problem.

# Once done, just press `q` to quit `s-tui`.
