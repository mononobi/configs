# the 'bin' folder contains some shortcut commands which can be copied into
# '.local' directory in your user's home directory.

# first open each file and edit 'USER' and 'PASSWORD' if needed, then execute this:

cp -r bin ~/.local

# then make the copied files executable:

chmod +x ~/.local/bin/*

# now you should logout and login again for changes to take effect.

# now you can execute those commands in the terminal without having to
# input your password every time.
