# the 'sbin' folder contains some shortcut commands which can be copied into
# '.local' directory in your user's home directory.

# first open each file and edit 'USER' and 'PASSWORD' if needed, then execute this:

cp -r sbin ~/.local

# then add these lines into '~/.profile' file:

######################## PUT BELOW LINES AT THE END OF THE FILE ########################

# set PATH so it includes user's private sbin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/sbin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/sbin:$PATH"
fi

######################## PUT ABOVE LINES AT THE END OF THE FILE ########################

# also add this to the final lines of '~/.bashrc' file where 'PATH' is defined.
# append this to the end of 'PATH' line:

# :~/.local/sbin:~/.local/bin

# then make the copied files executable:

sudo chmod 755 ~/.local/sbin/*

# now you should logout and login again for changes to take effect.

# now you can execute those commands in the terminal without having to
# input your password every time.
