# when you have dual-boot system, sometimes it might be possible that after
# installing some linux distros, the other os does not show up in boot menu.
# to fix that, execute these commands:

# recommended way:

sudo rm /boot/grub/grub.cfg
sudo update-grub

# alternate way (may not work):

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install os-prober
sudo os-prober
sudo update-grub

# restart the PC now.
