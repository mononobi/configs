# flatpak is the recommended way to install:

flatpak install flathub com.getpostman.Postman

# you can also install using snap, but it's not recommended at all as
# it has a terrible performance:

snap install postman --classic --channel=v9/stable

# always check for the latest channel before installing:

snap info postman
