# flatpak is the recommended way to install:

flatpak install flathub com.getpostman.Postman

######## IN CASE OF ERROR RELATED TO CERTIFICATES ########

# if postman crashes when clicking on its icon and does not open at all, run
# this to see the error:

flatpak run com.getpostman.Postman

# if the error is related to certificates not being found, execute these commands:

cd ~/.var/app/com.getpostman.Postman/config/Postman/proxy
openssl req -subj '/C=US/CN=Postman Proxy' -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout postman-proxy-ca.key -out postman-proxy-ca.crt

# now the app should start without any issues.

# you can also install using snap, but it's not recommended at all as
# it has a terrible performance:

snap install postman --classic --channel=v9/stable

# always check for the latest channel before installing:

snap info postman
