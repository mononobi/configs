# manual installation is recommended as you can get the latest version:

sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.11.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version

# apt installation is not recommended because it has an old version:

sudo apt-get install docker-compose
docker-compose --version
