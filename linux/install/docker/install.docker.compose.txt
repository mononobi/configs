################################## BEST APPROACH (RECOMMENDED) ##################################

# if you have followed the recommended installation approach from `install.docker.txt` file,
# `docker compose` has been already installed and accessible using `docker compose` command.
# with that approach you'll get both docker and docker compose with the latest versions
# and also with automatic updates through the regular system updates.

############## MANUAL INSTALLATION (BETTER THAN BELLOW BECAUSE OF LATEST VERSION) ##############

# with this approach you'll get the latest version but without automatic updates.
# for the latest version with automatic updates, follow the `best approach` above.

sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.35.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version

################## APT INSTALLATION (NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE OF OLD VERSIONS) ##################

sudo apt-get install docker-compose
docker-compose --version
