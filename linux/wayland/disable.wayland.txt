# wayland may cause some issues with multiple display setups.
# to disable wayland on any distro with gdm3 (ex. ubuntu), follow these steps:

# open this file:

sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf

# uncomment the line containing 'WaylandEnable=false' in the file.

# restart the gdm3 service:

sudo systemctl restart gdm3

# go into display settings of your distro and configure your monitors the way you
# want for your login screen (ex. internal laptop display disabled).
# click the save or apply button when done.

# execute this to copy your user's 'monitors.xml' file into the home folder for gdm user:

sudo cp ~/.config/monitors.xml ~gdm/.config/monitors.xml
sudo chown gdm:gdm ~gdm/.config/monitors.xml
