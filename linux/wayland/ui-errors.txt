# If you faced a UI crash on Wayland, try one of these commands to fix the issue
# as the X11 command (Alt + F2 + r) does not work on Wayland:

# If the mouse still works:

- Super + L: to lock the screen and log back in.

# If the mouse does not work but keyboard works:

- Ctrl + Alt + F3 (or F4/F5): This opens a text-only terminal.
- Login with username and password.
- Run this command: killall -HUP gnome-shell
- If did not go back to GUI, run this: Ctrl + Alt + F2

# The "Emergency" reboot when neither the mouse nor the keyboard works (REISUB):

- Hold Alt + SysRq (Print Screen).
- While holding them, slowly type R E I S U B
- This will safely unmount your drives and reboot the PC
