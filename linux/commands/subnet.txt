############################### IPv4 SUBNETTING ###############################

# IPv4 subnetting is defined like this:

192.168.1.0/24

# this includes all ips from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255

# each part of IPv4 address is 8 bits. and the subnet part defines
# how many bits of an IPv4 address are constant from left to right.

# examples:

# 192.0.0.0/8 -> this includes ips from 192.0.0.0 to 192.255.255.255
# /8 means that the first part is constant.

# 192.168.0.0/16 -> this includes ips from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
# /16 means that the first and second parts are constant.

# 192.168.1.0/24 -> this includes ips from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255
# /24 means that the first and second and third parts are constant.

# 192.168.1.10/32 -> this only includes a single ip 192.168.1.10
# /32 means that all parts are constant.

# so the subnet part is mostly one of /8 or /16 or /24 or /32
# subnet part may also be another values from /0 to /32 but its concept is more complicated.

############################### IPv6 SUBNETTING ###############################

# note that these ipv6 values are fictional and only for clarification.

# IPv6 subnetting is defined like this:

AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:0126:0000:0000:0000:0000/64

# this includes all ips from AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:0126:0000:0000:0000:0000 to AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:0126:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF

# each part of IPv6 address is 16 bits. and the subnet part defines
# how many bits of an IPv6 address are constant from left to right.

# examples:

# AAAA:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/16 -> this includes ips from AAAA:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to AAAA:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF
# /16 means that the first part is constant.

# AAAA:BBBB:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/32 -> this includes ips from AAAA:BBBB:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to AAAA:BBBB:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF
# /32 means that the first and second parts are constant.

# AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/48 -> this includes ips from AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF
# /48 means that the first and second and third parts are constant.

# AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:0000:0000:0000:0000/64 -> this includes ips from AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:0000:0000:0000:0000 to AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF
# /64 means that the first and second and third and fourth parts are constant.

# AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:0000:0000:0000/80 -> this includes ips from AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:0000:0000:0000 to AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF
# /80 means that the first and second and third and fourth and fifth parts are constant.

# AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:0000:0000/96 -> this includes ips from AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:0000:0000 to AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:FFFF:FFFF
# /96 means that the first and second and third and fourth and fifth and sixth parts are constant.

# AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:HHHH:0000/112 -> this includes ips from AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:HHHH:0000 to AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:HHHH:FFFF
# /112 means that the first and second and third and fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh parts are constant.

# AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:HHHH:IIII/128 -> this only includes a single ip AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD:EEEE:GGGG:HHHH:IIII
# /128 means that all parts are constant.

# so the subnet part is mostly one of /16 or /32 or /48 or /64 or /80 or /96 or /112 or /128
# subnet part may also be another values from /0 to /128 but its concept is more complicated.

############################### ABOUT PRIVATE IPv4 ###############################

# these subnets are defined as private ip addresses and are not available on public internet:

# 192.168.0.0/16 -> LAN
# ranging from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

# 172.16.0.0/12 -> Private Network (ex. docker, tun and ...)
# ranging from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

# 10.0.0.0/8 -> Private Network (ex. tun and ...)
# ranging from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

# 127.0.0.0/8 -> localhost (loopback)
# ranging from 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
# each device has its own localhost and no other device can access another device's localhost.
# for example if you run a docker container in your pc, the localhost of your pc and the
# localhost inside the container are different and cannot see each other.

################################## SYSTEM PROXY ##################################

# when you're using a system proxy, you can add these values into 'Ignore Hosts'
# field to be able to access local and private networks directly and bypassing proxy:

# localhost, 127.0.0.0/8, ::1, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8
