# fix the interrupted package manager:

sudo dpkg --configure -a

# get list of installed apt packages:

sudo apt list --installed

# CHANGE REPO SERVER (FOR EXAMPLE FROM REGIONAL TO MAIN SERVER):

# execute this to open the file:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

# remove the region part from all the urls inside the file.
# for example if this is a url:
# http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu

# remove the 'us.' from it, so it should become this:
# http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu

# after you've changed all the urls, execute this command to update the cache:

sudo apt-get update
