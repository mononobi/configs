# if you want to restore a branch which is completely deleted (local and remote) use this guide.

# execute this command and find the commits related to that branch:

git reflog --no-abbrev

# look through all commits and find the related commits. after that execute
# this command for each one of found commits and see if they work (you should
# replace 'SHA' with each one of commits sha values):

git checkout SHA

# if it didn't work, and you get an error, try this command:

git fsck --full --no-reflogs --unreachable --lost-found | grep commit | cut -d\  -f3 | xargs -n 1 git log -n 1 --pretty=oneline > .git/lost-found.txt

# now open the created '.git/lost-found.txt' file and look
# for related commits to your deleted branch.

# if you found a commit, execute this command (you should replace 'SHA'
# with each one of commits sha values):

git checkout SHA

# after you've checked out successfully, you can browse the code.

# if you want to make a branch from your founded commit, execute
# this (you should replace 'BRANCH_NAME' with a desirable name):

git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
