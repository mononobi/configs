# If you have a CPU with integrated graphics, to set the amount of system
# RAM that would be dedicated to the GPU, you can do the following:

- Enter the BIOS by pressing 'DEL' or 'F2' on startup.
- In the BIOS search for "UMA Frame Buffer Size", "VRAM Size" or something similar
  and set the amount of RAM you want to be dedicated to GPU.
- Save and reboot to the system.

# Recommended amount of RAM to be dedicated to GPU is 25% of available system RAM:

# More than 64GB of RAM -> 16GB of GPU RAM
# 32GB of RAM -> 8GB of GPU RAM
# 16GB of RAM -> 4GB of GPU RAM
# 8GB of RAM -> 2GB of GPU RAM
# 4GB of RAM -> 1GB of GPU RAM
# 2GB of RAM -> 0.5GB of GPU RAM
