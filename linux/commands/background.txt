# recommended way is to use tmux.
# nohup has some issues and sometimes the process stops after closing the shell.

# to run a command in the background which is detached from the shell, execute this:

nohup COMMAND &

# for example:

nohup python script.py &

# this will execute the command in the background, and you can close the shell
# without the command being stopped. the output of the command will be saved in
# a file named 'nohup.out' in the current directory.

# to find the process of the running background command, execute this:

ps -aux | grep COMMAND_NAME

# for example:

ps -aux | grep python

# to kill a background command, execute this after you have
# found its process id from above command:

kill -9 PROCESS_ID

# for example:

kill -9 56532
