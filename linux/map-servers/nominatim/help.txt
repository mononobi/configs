# nominatim is a service for geocoding (getting a geolocation from an address or name).
# the provided docker-compose file can be used to set up an on-premise nominatim instance.

# to see detailed info on this docker-compose file, visit here:
# 'https://github.com/mediagis/nominatim-docker'

# you can download the map data from this link:
# 'https://download.geofabrik.de'

# note that you should change the two mounted volumes to a location
# which is available on your server. you should change the host part only (left side).
# host:guest

# you should also set a password for database instance in the
# file instead of 'DATABASE_PASSWORD_OF_YOUR_CHOICE'.

# you can change the values of 'PBF_URL' and 'REPLICATION_URL' to get
# different map data for other locations.

# it is recommended to set 'shm_size' as half of your available ram.

# the 'IMPORT_STYLE' flag can be set to one of these values:

# admin: only import administrative boundaries and places.
# street: like the admin style but also adds streets.
# address: import all data necessary to compute addresses down to house number level.
# full: default style that also includes points of interest.
# extratags: like the full style but also adds most of the osm tags into the extratags column.

# if you want to enable updates, you can uncomment 'REPLICATION_URL' and
# 'REPLICATION_RECHECK_INTERVAL' flags. but you should note that if updates
# are enabled, the storage usage will grow much higher.

# if you've already downloaded the map data, you can comment 'PBF_URL' and uncomment
# 'PBF_PATH' instead. you should also uncomment the related volume.
# note that you can not set both 'PBF_URL' and 'PBF_PATH' at the same time.

# this docker-compose will prepare apache web-server, postgresql and nominatim instances.

# start the compose file:

docker-compose up -d

# if you've not enabled updates and don't want to do so, you can remove
# more than half of the data from database after import is finished.
# to do so, when import is finished and nominatim started serving requests,
# execute this command to go inside the container:

docker exec -it nominatim /bin/bash

# execute this inside the container:

su postgres

# go to nominatim folder inside the container:

cd /nominatim

# execute this:

nominatim freeze

# it might give an error on deleting the flatnode file, which can be ignored.

# exit from the container by executing this command two times in a row:

exit
