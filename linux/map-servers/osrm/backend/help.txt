# osrm is a service for navigation (getting directions between two points).
# the provided docker-compose file can be used to set up an on-premise osrm-backend instance.

# to see detailed info on this docker-compose file, visit these links:
# 'https://hub.docker.com/r/osrm/osrm-backend'
# 'https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend'

# you can download map data from this link:
# 'https://download.geofabrik.de'

# note that you should change 'lebanon-latest' to whichever file
# name that you have been downloaded as map data in all files.

# you should also create a folder named 'data' beside the
# 'docker-compose.yml' file and put the map data in it.

# this docker-compose will prepare osrm-backend instance.
# it does not include any web-servers (nginx or apache).

### WHEN YOU'VE CREATED DATA FOLDER AND RENAMED ALL 'lebanon-latest' TO YOUR FILE NAME ###

# execute this commands:

sudo chmod 775 1-initialize.sh 2-partition.sh 3-customize.sh

# now execute all 3 bash files one by one:

./1-initialize.sh
./2-partition.sh
./3-customize.sh

# now you can start the compose file:

docker-compose up -d
