# osrm is a service for navigation (getting directions between two points).
# the provided docker-compose file can be used to set up an on-premise osrm-frontend instance.

# to see detailed info on this docker-compose file, visit these links:
# 'https://hub.docker.com/r/osrm/osrm-frontend'
# 'https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-frontend'

# this docker-compose will prepare osrm-frontend instance.
# it does not include any web-servers (nginx or apache).

# you can change the value of 'OSRM_BACKEND' in compose file if
# your osrm backend is up on another address or port.
# note that if you set this variable, you should take care of CORS errors.

# start the compose file:

docker-compose up -d
