# there is an issue on ubuntu with gnome (and may be other distros) that when you
# lock the screen, the screen turns off but the monitor does not completely turn off
# and the backlight remains active. to solve this issue, there are two options:

# Option 1:

# this option will fix the issue on all scenarios including locking the screen using
# the menu, using the 'Super + L' combo and also automatic screen lock by the system.

# execute this to make the file executable:

sudo chmod 775 screen-lock

# add the file into startup apps and restart your pc.

# after restarting the system, whenever you lock the screen manually or system does
# it automatically, the monitor would be completely tuned off.

# Option 2 (NOT RECOMMENDED):

# this option only fixes the issue if you lock the screen manually using the 'Super + L' combo.
# to fix the issue on all scenarios use the option 1.

# install this if it's not already:

sudo apt install gnome-screensaver

# go to system settings:
# Settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> View and Customize Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts

# click on add (+) button and fill these fields:

# Name: Lock screen
# Command: bash -c "gnome-screensaver-command -l; sleep 0.5; xset dpms force off"
# Shortcut: Super + L

# now whenever you lock the screen using 'Super + L' the monitor would be completely tuned off.
