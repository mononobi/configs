# if after booting you are faced with a white background page that
# says "Oh no! Something has gone wrong", this could be due to an update
# that has not been fully applied because Ubuntu has deferred or held back updates.
# to fix this problem, first press this key combination on the error page to open
# the terminal:

# CTRL + ALT + F6

# other possible combinations on different systems:

# CTRL + ALT + F3
# CTRL + SHIFT + F4

# login to your account on the terminal.

# execute these commands:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo reboot

# now the problem is probably fixed.
