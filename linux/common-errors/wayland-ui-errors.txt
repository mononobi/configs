# If you faced a UI crash or unresponsiveness on Wayland, try one of the following commands
# to fix the issue.

# Important:
# Never execute (Alt + F2 + r) on Wayland because the Display Server and the UI
# are the same process. If that process (GNOME Shell) dies or restarts, your whole session dies.

# If the mouse still works:

- Super + L: to lock the screen and log back in.

# If the mouse does not work but keyboard works:

- Ctrl + Alt + F3 (or F4/F5): This opens a text-only terminal.
- Login with username and password.
- Run this command: killall -HUP gnome-shell
- If did not go back to GUI, run this: Ctrl + Alt + F2

# The "Emergency" reboot when neither the mouse nor the keyboard works (REISUB):

- Hold Alt + SysRq (Print Screen).
- While holding them, slowly type R E I S U B
- This will safely unmount your drives and reboot the PC
