# Generate RSA256 Key Pair

This guide outlines the steps to generate an RSA256 key pair (private and public keys) 
using `ssh-keygen` and `openssl`.

## Steps

1.  **Generate the RSA Private Key:**
    Use `ssh-keygen` to generate a 4096-bit RSA private key in PEM format. 
    It is recommended *not* to add a passphrase for certain use cases, such as JWT.

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f RS256.key
    ```

2.  **Extract the Public Key from the Private Key:**
    Use `openssl` to extract the public key in PEM format from the generated private key.

    ```bash
    openssl rsa -in RS256.key -pubout -outform PEM -out RS256.key.pub
    ```

3.  **Display the Private Key (Optional):**
    To view the content of your private key:

    ```bash
    cat RS256.key
    ```

4.  **Display the Public Key (Optional):**
    To view the content of your public key:

    ```bash
    cat RS256.key.pub
    ```
