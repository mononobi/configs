################# ADD THE PUBLIC KEY INTO THE SERVER FROM YOUR LOCAL MACHINE #################

################# YOU CAN COPY PUBLIC KEY TEXT INSTEAD OF FILE #################

# you can also copy the public key text directly and paste it on server:
# create this folder in user home on server:

sudo mkdir /home/user_name/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/user_name/.ssh
sudo chown user_name:user_name /home/user_name/.ssh

# now create this file on server:

sudo touch /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 600 /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown user_name:user_name /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys

################# YOU CAN COPY PUBLIC KEY TEXT INSTEAD OF FILE #################

# test whether you can login without providing password.

ssh user_name@server_ip

# if you were able to login without providing password, now you can disable 
# password login to server to prevent others who may detect your password from logging in.

################# THIS METHOD IS NOT RECOMMENDED SO USE THE SECOND METHOD #################

# get root privilege on server.

sudo su

# then execute below command to edit the file.

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# find ChallengeResponseAuthentication and set it as follows.

ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# find PasswordAuthentication and set it as follows.

PasswordAuthentication no

# find UsePAM and set it as follows.

UsePAM no

# find PermitRootLogin and set it as follows and save the file.

PermitRootLogin no

################# THIS METHOD IS NOT RECOMMENDED SO USE THE SECOND METHOD #################

################# THIS METHOD IS RECOMMENDED #################

# you could use the sample 'sshd_config_secure.conf' file contents into server.
# create this file on server:

sudo touch /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/sshd_config_secure.conf

# and copy the contents of local sample file into it.

################# THIS METHOD IS RECOMMENDED #################

# run below command to reset ssh service.

sudo systemctl reload ssh

# now only logins with created ssh keys are allowed, and direct login as root is also prohibited.
# it might be required to reboot server if changes not took effect.
