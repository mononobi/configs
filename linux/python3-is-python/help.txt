# if you don't need to install python2 on your system and also want to prevent some
# apps raising errors when they're accessing python. you can do the following to let all
# apps which are accessing python get access to python3 instead:

# execute this command:

ln -s /usr/bin/python3 ~/.local/bin/python

# now you can type python in the terminal and python3 shell will come up.
