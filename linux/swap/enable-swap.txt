# create a swap file at root:

sudo fallocate -l 5G /swapfile

# 5G will tell the command to create a 5 GB swapfile.

# if the 'fallocate' command is not available, use this command instead:

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=5242880

# note that: bs * count = swap_file_size_in_bytes
# so in this example: 1024 * 5242880 = 5368709120 Bytes (5GB)

# you can change 5G according to your needs. but consider these as a rule of thumb:

- systems with less than 2 GB RAM -> 2 times the amount of RAM.
- systems with 2 to 8 GB RAM -> the same size as the amount of RAM.
- systems with more than 8 GB RAM -> at least 4 GB of swap.

# set the permissions for created swapfile:

sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

# setup a linux swap area:

sudo mkswap /swapfile

# activate the swap:

sudo swapon /swapfile

# to make swap changes persistent, open '/etc/fstab' file:

sudo nano /etc/fstab

# add the following line into it:

/swapfile   none   swap   sw   0   0

# save the file.

# you can adjust the swappiness value of linux kernel.
# swappiness is a linux kernel property that defines how often the system will
# use the swap space. swappiness can have a value between 0 and 100. a low value
# will make the kernel to try to avoid swapping whenever possible while a higher
# value will make the kernel to use the swap space more aggressively.
# the default swappiness value is 60.

# show current swappiness value:

sudo cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

# while the swappiness value of 60 is OK for most linux systems, for production
# servers you should set a lower value.

# to change the swappiness value, execute this:

sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10

# to make this parameter persistent across reboots, open the '/etc/sysctl.conf' file:

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

# add this line into the file:

vm.swappiness=10

# save the file.
