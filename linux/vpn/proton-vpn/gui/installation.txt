# download the gui version app from this link:
# https://protonvpn.com/support/linux-ubuntu-vpn-setup/

# note that this website is already filtered in iran, so you have to solve
# the chicken and egg problem for downloading the vpn app.
# so, for your convenience the '.deb' file is already available on
# this repo if you could not download it from their site.

# execute this to add the proton-vpn repo in your linux:

sudo dpkg -i FILE_NAME.deb

# install the app:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install protonvpn

# you should create an account or login if you already have one.
# enjoy the free web without mollas of iran.
