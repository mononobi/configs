###################### IMPORTANT (DO NOT INSTALL PROTONVPN APPS) ######################

# proton vpn apps for linux (GUI, CLI) are a total garbage. they always crash, and
# they also fuck up your entire network connection even after uninstallation.
# DO NOT INSTALL THEM.

# you can use their openvpn configuration files and connect using openvpn instead.
