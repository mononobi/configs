# note that this website is already filtered in iran, so you have to solve
# the chicken and egg problem for downloading the vpn app.
# so, for your convenience the '.deb' file is already available on
# this repo if you could not download it from their site.

# execute this to install:

sudo dpkg -i FILE_NAME.deb

# you should create an account or login if you already have one.
# enjoy the free web without mullas of iran.
