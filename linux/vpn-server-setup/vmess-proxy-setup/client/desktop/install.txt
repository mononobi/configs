# you can also copy the app setting file provided here into its
# location in the app directory. for this, copy this file into
# this location:

# desktop/files/configs/nekoray.json -> APP_DIRECTORY/config/groups

########################### CREATE PROFILES ######################

# to create profiles to connect to INTERNAL or EXTERNAL servers, do the following:

# in the app, go to this menu:
# Server -> New profile

# input these values in the form:

# Type: VMess
# Name: a name for your profile
# Address: the INTERNAL or EXTERNAL server ip
# Port: 80 (if you have not changed port configuration on your server)
# UUID: the UUID of one of the clients which you have defined in your 'config.json' on the server
# Security: chacha20-poly1305
# Network: ws
# Path: /graphql

# leave other fields unchanged and save the profile.

# to connect to server:

# right click on one of your profiles and select start.
# now from the top menu select 'VPN Mode' or 'System Proxy'.

# note that if you choose 'System Proxy', some apps may not route through the proxy and
# you have to configure those apps manually. there also would be some dns leaks which can
# not be fixed in 'Proxy Mode'. but 'VPN Mode' will route all apps through
# proxy automatically and if configured correctly using the following guide, it would
# have zero dns leaks.

# if you choose 'System Proxy', add these values into 'Ignore Hosts' field
# of system proxy settings to be able to access local and private networks:

# localhost, 127.0.0.0/8, ::1, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8

########################### LINUX ONLY ###########################

# to create an app icon for nekoray on linux, do the following:

# stop the vpn and proxy if they are already connected and close the app from the tray.
# move the app folder into your home directory and make it hidden:

mv nekoray ~/.nekoray

# modify the 'nekoray.desktop' file and set your username instead of
# 'mono' in 'Icon' and 'Exec' values.
# copy the modified file into shortcuts location:

cp nekoray.desktop ~/.local/share/applications

# now reset the ui this way:
# press Alt and F2, then input r in the form and hit enter.
# now the app icon is shown on applications list.

# IMPORTANT BUG (OR BEHAVIOR) ONLY ON LINUX:

# if you use 'systemd-resolved' as dns resolver on your system, you should be aware
# that it has a very odd bug (behavior) which bypasses the iptables defined in system and
# sends dns queries out directly on the default gateway, causing that none of them reach
# to vpn interface (ex. nekoray-tun) to be tunneled through proxy and that will create
# lots of dns leaks. which that is because the nekoray linux app itself has another bug which
# leads to remote dns queries fail most of the time, so it falls back to system dns which
# is 'systemd-resolved' with its own bug.
# to overcome this, you have two options:

# OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED):

# set permanent dns servers in 'resolv.conf' file using the guide available
# in 'linux/dns-config/permanent.dns.secure.txt' file.
# this way all system dns queries would go through the vpn tunnel.
# note that if you just edit the 'resolv.conf' file manually, on each reboot the dns
# servers will reset to default. so follow the guide carefully. you can set these
# dns servers as permanent nameservers:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8888
nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8844

# OPTION 2:

# set a DoH server in your browser dns config, this way all dns queries will go through
# the vpn tunnel and everything works and your dns queries will not be exposed to
# mullahs. in each browser you want, set this as dns:

https://8.8.8.8/dns-query

# if you choose the option 2, in some browsers (chrome, chromium and ...) you can not access
# the internet if vpn is off. because all DoH servers are blocked by mullahs and these
# browsers do not fall back to system dns if secure dns is enabled. but firefox will
# fall back to system dns if secure dns is not reachable.

# this bug is not available on windows and android apps. so all remote dns
# queries on those platforms will go through vpn tunnel by default.
