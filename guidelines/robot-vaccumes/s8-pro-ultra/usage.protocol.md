# The "Trauma-Free" Hygiene Guide For Roborock S8 Pro Ultra

This guide is designed to maximize the Chemical and Biological defenses of your specific model 
to ensure zero mold growth, compensating for the Cold Water system.

## 1. The "Holy Trinity" of Prevention (Setup)
Do this on Day 1 to create a biological shield.

### The Silver Shield (Clean Tank)
- **Action:** Drop 1 Silver Ion Module (white/gray opaque beads) into the designated slot 
  inside the Clean Water Tank.
- **Why:** It releases ions that actively kill bacteria in the water before it enters the robot.
- **Replacement:** Every 12 months.

### The Chemical Shield (Clean Tank)
- **Action:** Add Roborock Omo Floor Cleaning Fluid (Blue Liquid).
- **Dose:** Manually add ~1/2 cap (or 1:300 ratio) to the Clean Water Tank every time you 
  refill it. Do NOT use general floor cleaners or vinegar.
- **Why:** Contains preservatives that prevent biofilm (slime) from forming in the pipes.

### The Thermal Shield (App Settings)
- **Action:** In "Dock Settings," ensure Auto-Drying duration is set to 4 Hours (Max).
- **Why:** Extreme dryness is the only defense against mold on the wet mop and base since 
  hot water washing is missing.

## 2. The Golden Rule of Usage
Mold grows fast in cold water. Frequent movement is required.

- **Standard Usage (Temp < 25°C):** Run the robot at least once every 5 days.
  - **Why:** Without hot water sterilization, biofilm begins to form in stagnant cold water 
    after 5 days. This forces the system to flush and refill with fresh, silver-charged water.
- **High Temp / Summer Usage (Temp > 25°C):** Run the robot at least once every 3 days.
  - **Why:** Heat accelerates bacterial growth. Water that is safe for 5 days in winter 
    will rot in 3 days in summer.
- **The "Lazy" Rule (CRITICAL):** If you don't want to clean the entire floors, send the 
  robot to perform a "Mop Only" run for a specific room for 10 minutes on "Max" water flow 
  until it runs out of water and refills the internal water tank.

## 3. Tank Maintenance Routine

### The Clean Water Tank (Source)
- **Routine:** Empty the clean water tank and rinse it after each cleaning session 
  (leave the Silver Ion Module in the empty tank).
- **Crucial:** If you refill it before it is empty, rinse it out first. Do not just 
  keep "topping it up," or sludge will form at the bottom.

### The Dirty Water Tank (Waste)
- **Best Practice:** Empty and rinse with tap water after every cleaning session.
- **Lazy Practice (Weekly Empty):** If you leave dirty water sitting for days, add 
  1 teaspoon of Dish Soap (e.g., Pril/Fairy) or floor cleaning solution into the 
  empty tank before putting it back.
- **Why:** The soap kills the smell as the dirty water drips in.

## 4. Deep Cleaning (Weekly - Mandatory)

### The Dock Tray (The "Slime Trap")
- **Action:** Manually scrub the bottom of the wash tray while it sits on the floor 
  (Note: The S8 tray is NOT detachable).
- **Frequency:** Weekly (Crucial due to lack of hot water).
- **Method:** Use a brush and paper towels to wipe the plastic base clean. Remove and 
  rinse the small high-speed maintenance brush (red) and the water filter on the right.
- **Why:** Sludge builds up in the corners and filter. Since it is not sterilized by 
  boiling water, this sludge turns into mold very quickly.

### The Internal Dustbin
- **Action:** Open the robot's top cover, remove the small dustbin.
- **Frequency:** Weekly.
- **Method:** Rinse it and let it dry for 24h before putting it back.
- **Why:** Ensure the auto-empty is working efficiently and no damp clumps are left behind to rot.

## 5. Vacation Drain (Away > 3-5 days)
If you are leaving the house, you MUST drain the robot based on the temperature.
- Standard Weather (<25°C): Trigger if away > 5 days.
- Hot Weather (>25°C): Trigger if away > 3 days.

**The Protocol:**
- Leave the Clean Water Tank empty and open (to air dry).
- **Drain the Internal Robot Tank:**
  - Remove the Clean Water Tank from the dock.
  - Start a "Mop Only" run for a specific room.
  - Let the robot run until it stops wetting the floor or gives a "Water Error."
  - Now the Internal Robot Tank is empty.
- Leave the Dirty Water Tank empty and open (to air dry).

## 6. The "Forbidden" List (Never Do This)
- ❌ No Vinegar in Clean Tank (Eats internal rubber seals).
- ❌ No Lemon/Citric Acid (Sugar feeds mold; acid eats seals).
- ❌ No Bleach (Destroys plastic).
- ❌ No 3rd Party Foaming Soap (Clogs pumps).
- ❌ Leaving the robot idle for more than 3 days in Summer or 5 days in Winter with water inside.

### Summary
- Silver + Omo + Max Drying = Daily Protection.
- Empty Clean Tank = Prevents "Slime" and extends the Silver Ion Module lifetime.
- Empty Dirty Tank = Prevents "Sewage Smell".
- Vacation Drain = Prevents "Internal Slime".
