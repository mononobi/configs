# The "Trauma-Free" Hygiene Guide For Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 ProX

This guide is designed to maximize the 100°C Sterilization and Warm Water Refill features of 
your specific model to ensure zero mold growth.

## 1. The "Holy Trinity" of Prevention (Setup)
Do this on Day 1 to create a biological shield.

### The Silver Shield (Clean Tank)
*   **Action:** Drop 1 Silver Ion Module (white/gray opaque beads) into the Clean Water Tank.
*   **Why:** It releases ions that actively kill bacteria in the water before it enters the robot.
*   **Replacement:** Every 12 months.

### The Chemical Shield (Clean Tank)
*   **Action:** Add Roborock Omo Floor Cleaning Fluid (Blue Liquid).
*   **Dose:** Follow bottle instructions (usually ~1/2 cap for full tank). Do NOT use general 
    floor cleaners or vinegar.
*   **Why:** Contains preservatives that prevent biofilm (slime) from forming in the pipes.

### The Thermal Shield (App Settings)
*   **Action:** In "Dock Settings," ensure Mop Washing Temperature is set to High / 100°C.
*   **Why:** Boiling water kills the spores that chemicals miss.

## 2. The Golden Rule of Usage
Mold grows in stagnant water. Movement is life.

*   **Standard Usage (Temp < 25°C):** Run the robot at least once every 7 days.
    *   **Why:** This forces the water inside the robot's internal "stomach" to be flushed out and 
        replaced with a fresh, hot, silver-charged batch.
*   **High Temp / Summer Usage (Temp > 25°C):** Run the robot at least once every 5 days.
    *   **Why:** Heat accelerates bacterial growth. Water that is safe for 7 days in winter 
        will rot in 5 days in summer.
*   **The "Lazy" Rule (CRITICAL):** If you don't want to clean the entire floors, send the 
    robot to perform a "Mop Only" run for a specific room for 5 minutes on "Max" water flow 
    until it runs out of water and refills the internal water tank.

## 3. Tank Maintenance Routine

### The Clean Water Tank (Source)
*   **Routine:** Empty the clean water tank and rinse it after each cleaning session 
    (leave the Silver Ion Module in the empty tank).
*   **Crucial:** If you refill it before it is empty, rinse it out first. Do not just keep 
    "topping it up" for 3 months, or sludge will form at the bottom.

### The Dirty Water Tank (Waste)
*   **Best Practice:** Empty and rinse with tap water after every cleaning session.
*   **Lazy Practice (Weekly Empty):** If you leave dirty water sitting for days, add 1 teaspoon 
    of Dish Soap (e.g., Pril/Fairy) or floor cleaning solution into the empty tank before 
    putting it back.
*   **Why:** The soap kills the smell as the dirty water drips in.

## 4. Deep Cleaning (Weekly for Humid Climates / Monthly for Dry)

### The Dock Tray (The "Slime Trap")
*   **Action:** Pull out the detachable wash tray at the bottom of the dock.
*   **Frequency:** Weekly (Crucial in humid climates).
*   **Method:** Wash it in the sink with hot water and a brush. Clean the small 
    filter mesh on the right side.
*   **Why:** The self-cleaning scraper pushes dirt into this filter. In humid air, wet lint 
    can start smelling like a "damp towel" in 7 days.

### The Internal Dustbin
*   **Action:** Open the robot's top cover, remove the small dustbin.
*   **Frequency:** Weekly (Crucial in humid climates).
*   **Method:** Rinse it and let it dry for 24h before putting it back.
*   **Why:** High humidity can make fine dust sticky, preventing the auto-empty dock from 
    sucking it all out.

## 5. Vacation Drain (Away > 5-7 days)
If you are leaving the house, you MUST drain the robot based on the temperature.
- Standard Weather (<25°C): Trigger if away > 7 days.
- Hot Weather (>25°C): Trigger if away > 5 days.

**The Protocol:**
*   Leave the Clean Water Tank empty and open (to air dry).
*   **Drain the Internal Robot Tank:**
    *   Go to App > Robot Settings > Dock Settings.
    *   Tap the words "Dock Settings" 10 times quickly.
    *   Select "Empty Internal Water Tank" (or similar service option) from the hidden menu.
    *   The robot will pump itself dry.
*   Leave the Dirty Water Tank empty and open (to air dry).

## 6. The "Forbidden" List (Never Do This)
*   ❌ No Vinegar in Clean Tank (Eats internal rubber seals).
*   ❌ No Lemon/Citric Acid (Sugar feeds mold; acid eats seals).
*   ❌ No Bleach (Destroys plastic).
*   ❌ No 3rd Party Foaming Soap (Clogs pumps).
*   ❌ Leaving the robot idle for more than 5 days in Summer or 7 days in Winter with water inside.

## Summary
*   **Silver + Omo + Heat** = Daily Protection.
*   **Empty Clean Tank** = Prevents "Slime" and extends the Silver Ion Module lifetime.
*   **Empty Dirty Tank** = Prevents "Sewage Smell".
*   **Vacation Drain** = Prevents "Internal Slime".
